        The University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH) is proud to announce

            Important for Patients
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            Patients will notice faster service during visits as medical staff
            can quickly access complete health records. This means more time for
            quality care and less time waiting for paperwork and records
            retrieval.
          </p>
        </div>

      <h3>Implementation Timeline</h3>
      <p>
        The EHR system rollout began in July 2025 with extensive staff training
        across all departments. The phased implementation approach ensured
        minimal disruption to patient services:
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Phase 1 (July):</span> Administrative departments and
        outpatient clinics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Phase 2 (August):</span> Emergency department and diagnostic
        services
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Phase 3 (September):</span> Inpatient wards and surgical
        departments.
      </p>
      <p>
        All departments are now fully operational on the new system, with
        ongoing support and additional training sessions scheduled throughout
        the coming months.
      </p>

      <h3>Benefits for Healthcare Providers</h3>
      <p>
        Medical staff have reported significant improvements in their daily
        workflows. Dr. Sarah Okafor, Head of Internal Medicine, stated: "The new
        system has transformed how we deliver patient care. Having instant
        access to complete patient histories and test results has dramatically
        improved our diagnostic capabilities."
      </p>
      <p>
        Nursing staff have also praised the system's user-friendly interface and
        mobile accessibility, allowing them to update patient records directly
        from bedside tablets, reducing paperwork and increasing time spent on
        direct patient care.
      </p>
